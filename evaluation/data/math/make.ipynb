      "Example 1:\n",
      "Problem: Chandra has four bowls.  Each one is a different color (red, blue, yellow, green).  She also has exactly one glass the same color as each bowl.  If she chooses a bowl and a glass from the cupboard, how many pairings are possible?  One such pairing is a blue bowl and a yellow glass.\n",
      "Solution: There are four different bowls and four different glasses that Chandra can pick. Since her choices are mutually exclusive, there are $4 \\times 4 = \\boxed{16}$ possible pairings. So the answer is \\boxed{16}.\n",
      "Example 2:\n",
      "Problem: The distance between two cities on a map is 15 inches. If the scale is 0.25 inches = 3 miles, how many miles apart are the actual cities?\n",
      "Solution: If 0.25 inches represents 3 miles, we have that 1 inch represents 12 miles. Therefore, 15 inches represents $\\boxed{180\\text{ miles}}$. So the answer is \\boxed{180\\text{ miles}}.\n",
      "Example 3:\n",
      "Problem: How many prime numbers are between 20 and 30?\n",
      "Solution: Checking the primes 2, 3, and 5 as potential divisors, we see that there are $\\boxed{2}$ prime numbers between 20 and 30: 23 and 29. So the answer is \\boxed{2}.\n",
      "Example 4:\n",
      "Problem: How many positive integers less than $101$ are multiples of either $5$ or $7$, but not both at once?\n",
      "Solution: There are $20$ positive multiples of $5$ less than $101$.  There are $14$ positive multiples of $7$ less than $101$.  However, the least common multiple of $5$ and $7$ is $35$, and there are $2$ positive multiples of $35$ less than $101$.  This means there are $20 - 2 = 18$ multiples of $5$ that aren't multiples of $7$, and $14 - 2 = 12$ multiples of 7 that aren't multiples of $5$, for a total of $18 + 12 = \\boxed{30}$. So the answer is \\boxed{30}.\n",
      "Example 5:\n",
      "Problem: What is $\\frac{2^2 \\cdot 2^{-3}}{2^3 \\cdot 2^{-2}}$?\n",
      "Solution: We compute that \\[\\frac{2^2 \\cdot 2^{-3}}{2^3 \\cdot 2^{-2}} = \\frac{2^{2 - 3}}{2^{3 - 2}} = \\frac{2^{-1}}{2^1} = 2^{-1 - 1} = 2^{-2} = \\frac{1}{2^2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}.\\] So the answer is \\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}.\n",
      "Example 6:\n",
      "Problem: What is the value of $\\dfrac{3 \\times 4}{6}?$\n",
      "Solution: Calculating the numerator first, $\\dfrac{3 \\times 4}{6} = \\dfrac{12}{6} = \\boxed{2}$. So the answer is \\boxed{2}.\n",
      "Example 7:\n",
      "Problem: A gift shop offers free gift wrapping. They have eight varieties of wrapping paper, three colors of ribbon, and four types of gift cards. Using one variety of wrapping paper, one color of ribbon and one type of gift card, how many combinations are possible?\n",
      "Solution: There are $8\\times 3\\times 4=\\boxed{96}$ ways to make three decisions if there are 8, 3, and 4 options available for the decisions. So the answer is \\boxed{96}.\n",
      "Example 8:\n",

Solving this equation gives $x = 54^\\circ$.  We therefore have $\\angle BXY = \\angle AXE = \\boxed{54^\\circ}$. So the answer is \\boxed{54^\\circ}.\n",
